            'Competition is one of the defining features of organizational life. In this research, we identify a prevalent but overlooked type of competition—covert competition, which we define as behaviors with the intention to win (i.e., advancing one’s interest/position while disregarding or hurting the other party’s interest/position) that is unclear to or hidden from the other party. We argue that one’s relative power in dyadic social relationships influences covert competition. Based on the theory of power-dependence, we expect that lower-power individuals are more likely than higher-power individuals to compete covertly. This is because lower-power individuals fear the potential negative repercussions of revealing their competitiveness, which motivates them to engage in more covert competition. Lower-power individuals’ ability to escape from the current relationship mitigates the effects of having lower power on such fear and on their subsequent covert competition. With five experiments and a three-wave longitudinal survey study, we find support for our hypotheses. This research calls attention to the understudied covert form of competition and emphasizes the nuanced relationships between power and competitive behaviors.',

        abstract:
            'Although subordinate-to-supervisor relational identification (RI) has gained significant scholarly attention in organizational research, an understanding of the nomological network of relational identification is incomplete. There have also been recurring discussions about its distinctions with another more extensively researched relational construct – leader-member exchange (LMX). In this meta-analysis, we expand Sluss and Ashforth’s (2007) typology, going beyond the influence of the supervisor, to systematically study the antecedents and consequences of relational identification and RI’s comparison with LMX. The meta-analytic results based on 157 independent samples demonstrate that positive leader behaviors that span role- and person-based identities (e.g., transformational leadership, supervisor humility) are important antecedents of subordinate-to-supervisor RI, with effects contingent on subordinates’ national culture (i.e., collectivism and power distance). Relational and organizational contexts as well as subordinate characteristics, although less hypothesized, are also important antecedents of subordinate-to-supervisor RI. The results further show that RI relates to important subordinate behaviors and attitudes. Finally, we test RI’s incremental predictive validity and show that RI has independent effects on important organization-relevant outcomes beyond LMX. We conclude with suggestions to enhance our understanding of RI.',

        abstract:
            'Despite the prevalence of teams failing to perform, limited management research has revealed how teams overcome poor performance. In this paper, we seek to explore this understudied area by focusing on team status dynamics. Integrating research on status hierarchy conflict and team membership change, we propose that teams are more likely to add higher-status new members after failure, and that the tendency of failed teams to add higher-status members varies depending on the extent of status differentiation within the team. We contend that failed teams with greater status differentiation may perceive the addition of higher-status members as a threat to the existing status dynamics, making them less inclined to adopt this approach. In contrast, teams with lower status differentiation are more likely to add higher-status members, which leads to improved team performance. To support these hypotheses, we analyzed a dataset containing 5,283 teams from a major social networking company. This research helps advance research on team membership change, hierarchy, and the aftermath of failure.'
