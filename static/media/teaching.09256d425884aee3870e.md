My teaching philosophy is heavily influenced by evidence-based practices. I incorporate empirical evidence and research findings into my teaching process to foster effective learning, help students understand organizations, and prepare students for the workplace. I have found great value in this approach toward the development of my own teaching goals: **(1) Maximizing Knowledge via Engagement** (making academic knowledge easily understandable by making connections with students’ daily experiences and real-world organizations), **(2) Fostering Confidence** (developing students’ self-understanding and career-relevant skills), and **(3) Celebrating Diversity, Inclusion, and Belongingness** (encouraging students from all backgrounds to feel comfortable expressing their unique perspectives).

I have successfully taught a core Organizational Behavior course as a sole instructor for two semesters, earning high ratings and positive comments. By integrating research findings, employing active learning techniques, and enhancing students’ skills, I strive to create an engaging, supportive, and inclusive learning environment that empowers all students to become active participants in their own education and prepares them for success in their professional pursuits.

I am deeply passionate about and committed to my role as a teacher. I am ready and eager to teach courses in organizational behavior and human resource management, including negotiation, power and politics, leadership, decision-making, diversity and inclusion, teams, and research methods and statistics, at all levels.
